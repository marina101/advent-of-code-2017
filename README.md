## Day 3:

--- Day 3: Spiral Memory ---

You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.

Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:

17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ...

While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan Distance between the location of the data and square 1.

For example:

    Data from square 1 is carried 0 steps, since it's at the access port.
    Data from square 12 is carried 3 steps, such as: down, left, left.
    Data from square 23 is carried only 2 steps: up twice.
    Data from square 1024 must be carried 31 steps.

How many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?

Your puzzle answer was 475.
--- Part Two ---

As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.

So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:

    Square 1 starts with the value 1.
    Square 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it also stores 1.
    Square 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 2.
    Square 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 4.
    Square 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value 5.

Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:

147  142  133  122   59
304    5    4    2   57
330   10    1    1   54
351   11   23   25   26
362  747  806--->   ...

What is the first value written that is larger than your puzzle input?

## Day 4:
--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

    aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
    aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
    aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.

The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?

Your puzzle answer was 325.
--- Part Two ---

For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

For example:

    abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
    abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
    a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
    iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
    oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.

Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?

## Day 5
--- Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike ---

An urgent interrupt arrives from the CPU: it's trapped in a maze of jump instructions, and it would like assistance from any programs with spare cycles to help find the exit.

The message includes a list of the offsets for each jump. Jumps are relative: -1 moves to the previous instruction, and 2 skips the next one. Start at the first instruction in the list. The goal is to follow the jumps until one leads outside the list.

In addition, these instructions are a little strange; after each jump, the offset of that instruction increases by 1. So, if you come across an offset of 3, you would move three instructions forward, but change it to a 4 for the next time it is encountered.

For example, consider the following list of jump offsets:

0
3
0
1
-3

Positive jumps ("forward") move downward; negative jumps move upward. For legibility in this example, these offset values will be written all on one line, with the current instruction marked in parentheses. The following steps would be taken before an exit is found:

    (0) 3  0  1  -3  - before we have taken any steps.
    (1) 3  0  1  -3  - jump with offset 0 (that is, don't jump at all). Fortunately, the instruction is then incremented to 1.
     2 (3) 0  1  -3  - step forward because of the instruction we just modified. The first instruction is incremented again, now to 2.
     2  4  0  1 (-3) - jump all the way to the end; leave a 4 behind.
     2 (4) 0  1  -2  - go back to where we just were; increment -3 to -2.
     2  5  0  1  -2  - jump 4 steps forward, escaping the maze.

In this example, the exit is reached in 5 steps.

How many steps does it take to reach the exit?

Your puzzle answer was 358309.
--- Part Two ---

Now, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was three or more, instead decrease it by 1. Otherwise, increase it by 1 as before.

Using this rule with the above example, the process now takes 10 steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as 2 3 2 3 -1.

How many steps does it now take to reach the exit?

## Day 6

--- Day 6: Memory Reallocation ---

A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.

In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.

The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.

The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.

For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:

    The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.
    Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.
    Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.
    Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.
    The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.
    The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.

At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.

Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?

Your puzzle answer was 11137.
--- Part Two ---

Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?

In the example above, 2 4 1 2 is seen again after four cycles, and so the answer in that example would be 4.

How many cycles are in the infinite loop that arises from the configuration in your puzzle input?

## Day 7

--- Day 7: Recursive Circus ---

Wandering further through the circuits of the computer, you come upon a tower of programs that have gotten themselves into a bit of trouble. A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.

One program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with no disc of their own.

You offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if they're holding a disc) the names of the programs immediately above them balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.

For example, if your list is the following:

pbga (66)
xhth (57)
ebii (61)
havc (66)
ktlj (57)
fwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth
qoyq (66)
padx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq
tknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft
jptl (61)
ugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl
gyxo (61)
cntj (57)

...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:

                gyxo
              /     
         ugml - ebii
       /      \     
      |         jptl
      |        
      |         pbga
     /        /
tknk --- padx - havc
     \        \
      |         qoyq
      |             
      |         ktlj
       \      /     
         fwft - cntj
              \     
                xhth

In this example, tknk is at the bottom of the tower (the bottom program), and is holding up ugml, padx, and fwft. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this example, none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their own towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)

Before you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct. What is the name of the bottom program?

Your puzzle answer was svugo.
--- Part Two ---

The programs explain the situation: they can't get down. Rather, they could get down, if they weren't expending all of their energy trying to keep the tower balanced. Apparently, one program has the wrong weight, and until it's fixed, they're stuck here.

For any program holding a disc, each program standing on that disc forms a sub-tower. Each of those sub-towers are supposed to be the same weight, or the disc itself isn't balanced. The weight of a tower is the sum of the weights of the programs in that tower.

In the example above, this means that for ugml's disc to be balanced, gyxo, ebii, and jptl must all have the same weight, and they do: 61.

However, for tknk to be balanced, each of the programs standing on its disc and all programs above it must each match. This means that the following sums must all be the same:

    ugml + (gyxo + ebii + jptl) = 68 + (61 + 61 + 61) = 251
    padx + (pbga + havc + qoyq) = 45 + (66 + 66 + 66) = 243
    fwft + (ktlj + cntj + xhth) = 72 + (57 + 57 + 57) = 243

As you can see, tknk's disc is unbalanced: ugml's stack is heavier than the other two. Even though the nodes above ugml are balanced, ugml itself is too heavy: it needs to be 8 units lighter for its stack to weigh 243 and keep the towers balanced. If this change were made, its weight would be 60.

Given that exactly one program is the wrong weight, what would its weight need to be to balance the entire tower?

## Day 8

--- Day 8: I Heard You Like Registers ---

You receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with jump instructions, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions.

Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:

b inc 5 if a > 1
a inc 1 if b < 5
c dec -10 if a >= 1
c inc -20 if c == 10

These instructions would be processed as follows:

    Because a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.
    a is increased by 1 (to 1) because b is less than 5 (it is 0).
    c is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).
    c is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.

After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.

You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.

What is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle input?

Your puzzle answer was 3612.
--- Part Two ---

To be safe, the CPU also needs to know the highest value held in any register during this process so that it can decide how much memory to allocate to these operations. For example, in the above instructions, the highest value ever held was 10 (in register c after the third instruction was evaluated).
